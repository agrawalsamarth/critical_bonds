# Critical bonds for percolated clusters

We here offer two versions of the critical_bonds software that returns the critical bonds for a 2D or 3D undirected bond-connected network of nodes in the presence of periodic boundary conditions: [c++](#c++) and [MATLAB](#MATLAB) versions. Both versions operate on a standardized input file format described below. The input file carries information about the box size, coordinates of nodes, and bonded pairs of nodes. We offer [converters](#converters) to this input file format from other data formats like LAMMPS data files. Other converters will follow. Suggestions for required converters are welcome. The MATLAB version optionally produces graphical output and/or a LAMMPS data file that masks the critical bonds by bond type 2. 

This software is part of the Supplemental Information of the following publication:

### Installation

Clone this Github repository. Then install the code via make

         git clone https://github.com/agrawalsamarth/critical_bonds;
         cd critical_bonds; 
         make critical_bonds

Note that Eigen library is required. It comes with this repository. If necessary, it can be installed separately via 

          git clone https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen.git

### Usage

         ./bin/critical_bonds <input_filename> <output_filename>

### Format of the input_filename<a name=input>

For 2D configurations the entries in brackets are absent. The coordinates of the nodes should be between the specified box sizes (xlo, xhi) etc. Node IDs start at 0 and end at number of nodes-1, ie, the first row of the coordinates table corresponds to the node with id 0, and the last row of this table has id number of nodes - 1. These id values are then used to build the corresponding bond table.

    dimensions                     <- space dimension, either 2 or 3
    xlo xhi ylo yhi [zlo zhi]      <- box ranges
    N                              <- number of nodes
    x y [z]                        <- this is the coordinate of node 0
    x y [z]                        <- this is the coordinate of node 1
    ...
    x y [z]                        <- this is the coordinate of node N-1
    number of bonds                <- number of bonded pairs of nodes
    b1 b2                          <- node b1 is bonded to node b2
    b1 b2                          
    ...
    b1 b2                          <- node b1 is bonded to node b2

#### Example: 

2D Configuration. 5 nodes connected by 7 bonds contained in a periodic box of size [0 1] x [-0.2 1.1]:

    2
    0 1 -0.2 1.1
    5
    0.2 0.3  
    -0.1 0.5 
    0.4 0.2 
    0.8 0.3
    0.7 0.4
    7
    2 3
    0 1
    1 2
    3 1 
    1 4
    4 2
    3 2

### Format of the output_filename

    b1 b2                          <- 1st critical bond between node b1 and node b2
    b1 b2                          <- 2nd critical bond between node b1 and node b2
    ...
    b1 b2                          <- last critical bond between node b1 and node b2

### Convert from LAMMPS data format to input file format

         perl convert-lammps-data-2-cb.pl <lammps-data-file> [-o <outputfile>]

where outputfile is formatted according to the [above](#input) section so that it can be used directly.
